# Biblio search

This was my Capstone Stage 2 task while studying at udacity


Biblio search roughly translates to book search. It is an app that allows book lovers or (biblophiles) to search and discover new books they should read. The app draws data from the Google books API and present it to the user in a delightful manner.

## Tech Used
* MVVM 
* Retrofit, GSON and OkHttp
* Glide
* LiveData
* ViewModel
* Room Database 

## Next Steps
Because this was initially my Udacity project, I was limited to using some specific tools. 
Some things I would like to do include:
* Refactor Codebase to Kotlin
* Use Coroutines or RXJava for async operations
* Add Paging Library support
* Dependency Injection (Preferably Hilt) 


## Installation

Simply clone the repo and import into Android studio with gradle. Addition release links and Playstore links will be made available when ready.
